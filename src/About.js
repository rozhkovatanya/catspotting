        <Greeting>Hi there!</Greeting>
        <TextBox>
          I won't lie to you - the real purpose to create this game was the
          ability to write "Creator of Catspotting" in my social media accounts'
          description. Sounds cool, huh? üòÅ
          <br />
          <br />
          Okay, now seriously:
          <br />
          <br />
          This is my first code project ever, so don't judge me too harshly.
          I've started learning React during quarantine 2020 and after I
          finished one video course I came up with the idea of Catspotting
          creation. The plan was simple: I have a long-standing addiction to
          memes and cats + now I'm trying to learn coding. Why not combine all
          these things together? Sounds like a lot of fun, however, the
          development process appeared to be much harder than I expected.
          Believe me, there was an entire ocean of tears and struggle. This game
          would never see the world without constant psychological support and
          wise guidance of @rip212. Thank you!
          <br />
          <br />
          If you have any ideas on how to improve Catspotting - don't hesitate
          to contact me. From my side, I promise that I will be improving this
          project as long as I can.
          <br />
          <br />
          Okay, now I'm done whining about this üò∏
          <br />
          <br />
          Thanks to all who had enough patience to read this till the very end.
          Now go play Catspotting!
